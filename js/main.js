/*
i think the play is, we set up a chess board like normal
then we just random of times iterate through random pieces - lets say x turns (turn being 1 sides action)
and then we randomly select a piece (lets say piece-y) and then we check all possible legal moves for piece-y
and then we randomly select one of those legal moves and move piece-y to that location

if piece-y can not move, we reselect another piece-y and try again

and then we repeat this x times

caviats:
need to make sure niether kings are in mate... or check... or stalemate
ig if no piece-y can legally move thats a stalemate... so we can end it there...

ill make it up as i go
